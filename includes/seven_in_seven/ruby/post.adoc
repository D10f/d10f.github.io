This is a language that has been on my radar for a while, but unfortunately it's been in my ever-growing list of _things to look into at some point_ for far too long.

I immediately caught some hints of Perl here and there, but the syntax felt more intuitive or at least more similar to what I'm already used to compared to other languages.
