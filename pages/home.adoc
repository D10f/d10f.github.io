Welcome to my small piece of the internet.

I'm a web developer from Spain who enjoys tinkering with things, especially in the realm of the web.

You can https://localhost:3000/blog[read the notes and guides] that I write for my future self, mostly about web development, system administration and open source software in general.

Or you can go over some of https://localhost:3000/projects[my favorite projects]; if you are interested, take a look at https://localhost:3000/uses[what tools I use] to make them.
